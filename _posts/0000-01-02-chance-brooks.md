Our "Bop it" project will be to create a retro style arcade machine to play on. The player inputs will be a joystick and button in typical arcade cabinet
fashion as well as a microphone. Next to the gameplay button will also be a button to start a new game. The power switch will be located on the back of 
the cabinet and a power LED will be placed on top. In place of a screen will be a seven segment display to output the player's score.
